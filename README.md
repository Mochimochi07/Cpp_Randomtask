# Cpp_Randomtask
This is my Random task repo

Hey, its a Randomtask CLI example.
This should be in fun programs repo. but i kinda need to make it go it out.
I used High on Life as a little modification with LEZ and Kenny.
It do like the app because of Lez.
Yea, just saying "Let's do it!" still reminds me of Golang.
I might reconsider changing my fun programs to C++.
It would have been good if i included the "WE DID IT!"
we'll see in the future.
